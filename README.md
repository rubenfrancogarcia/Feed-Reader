# Project Overview

In this project you(me) are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.


## Access
testing is run using Jasmine g
To run the application, you must either download directly from folder via git or clone the repository via the link git hub gives you into your terminal
`git clone link https://github.com/rubenfrancogarcia/Feed-Reader.git`
